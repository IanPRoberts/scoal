\title{Migration Shift MCMC Proposal}
\usage{
ed.mig.shift.2(ED, n.deme, sd = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{ED}{Extended data object; matrix with columns Node ID, parent, child 1, child 2, deme, node age}

\item{n.deme}{Number of distinct demes in the population}

\item{sd}{Standard deviation of the perturbations}
}
\value{
Updated extended data object with the proposal from the migration shift proposal
}
\description{
Performs a migration shift MCMC proposal on a structured coalescent
migration history. A migration event is selected uniformly at random
and the time of the event is updated by perturbing the event time by a
N(0, var) random variable with reflecting boundaries at the times of the
preceding and following events.
