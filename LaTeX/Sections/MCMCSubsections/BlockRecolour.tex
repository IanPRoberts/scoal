Let a block of a structured coalescent genealogy be a maximal subtree of the migration history contained in a single deme. Then a block recolouring proposal aims to select a block within the migration history and resample the deme over that block.

A block of the migration history is selected with probability proportional to the length of the edges contained in the block, and a new deme is proposed over the block (not equal to the current deme). If the proposed deme does not provide a consistent deme labelling, reject the move.

The proposal ratio for the block recolouring proposal is then given by
	\begin{align*}
		Q_{BR}(\calT' | \calT) & = \bbP [\substack{\text{Selected} \\ \text{block}}] \cdot \bbP [\substack{\text{Proposed} \\ \text{deme}}] \\
		& = \frac{\calL_\text{block}}{\calL} \cdot \frac{1}{d-1}.
	\end{align*}
This move is symmetric in that
	\[
		Q_{BR} (\calT | \calT') = Q_{BR}(\calT' | \calT),
	\]
and hence the proposal ratio is simply
	\[
		\frac{Q_{BR} (\calT | \calT')}{Q_{BR} (\calT' | \calT)} = 1.
	\]
