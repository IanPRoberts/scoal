\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\calT$] Phylogeny with migration history (Structured phylogenetic tree)
	\item[$d$] Number of distinct demes
	\item[$\Lambda$] Migration matrix $\Lambda = [\Lambda_{ij}]_{i,j=1}^d$ such that $\Lambda_{ij} = \lambda_{ij} = \lambda_{i \rightarrow j}$ is the migration rate from deme $i$ into deme $j$ backwards in time. Note that self-migrations are forbidden, i.e. $\lambda_{ii} = 0$ $\forall i = 1,2, \dots, d$.
	\item[$\theta$] Effective population vector such that $\theta_i$ is the effective population in deme $i$
	\item[$g$] Mean generation length for individuals in the overall population ($g > 0$)
	\item[$M$] Total number of migration events
	\item[$n$] Number of leaves (tips) in the tree
\end{itemize}
